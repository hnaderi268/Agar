# Agar

Agar is a multiplayer game written in java. It works in a local network using sockets.
I did this as a project when I was learning java.

Each player has some balls in a 2D space. When a bigger ball hits a smaller ball it gets bigger and the smaller ball disappears. The winners is the last to stay.
